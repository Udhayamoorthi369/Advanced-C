The exec() family of functions creates a new process image from a regular, executable file. This file is either an executable object file, or an interpreter script. There is no return from a successful call to an exec() function, because the calling process is functionally replaced by the new process.

An interpreter script begins with a line of the form:

#! pathname [arg]
