### What is RISC and CISC Architectures?
* A complex instruction set computer is a computer where single instructions can perform numerous low-level operations like a load from memory, an arithmetic operation, and a memory store or are accomplished by multi-step processes or addressing modes in single instructions, as its name proposes “Complex Instruction Set ”.

* A reduced instruction set computer is a computer that only uses simple commands that can be divided into several instructions which achieve low-level operation within a single CLK cycle, as its name proposes “Reduced Instruction Set ”


## RISC Architecture
* The term RISC stands for ‘’Reduced Instruction Set Computer’’. It is a CPU design plan based on simple orders and acts fast.

* This is a small or reduced set of instructions. Here, every instruction is expected to attain very small jobs. In this machine, the instruction sets are modest and simple, which help in comprising more complex commands. Each instruction is about a similar length; these are wound together to get compound tasks done in a single operation. Most commands are completed in one machine cycle. This pipelining is a crucial technique used to speed up RISC machines.

* Reduced Instruction Set Computer is a microprocessor that is designed to carry out few instructions at a similar time. Based on small commands, these chips need fewer transistors, which makes the transistors inexpensive to design and produce. The features of RISC include the following
 
* The demand for decoding is less
* Few data types in hardware
* General-purpose register Identical
* Uniform instruction set
* Simple addressing nodes
* Also, while writing a program, RISC makes it easier by letting the computer programmer eliminate needless codes and stops wasting cycles.

## Characteristics
The characteristics of RISC architecture include the following.

* Simple Instructions are used in RISC architecture.
* RISC helps and supports few simple data types and synthesizes complex data types.
* RISC utilizes simple addressing modes and fixed-length instructions for pipelining.
* RISC permits any register to use in any context.
* One Cycle Execution Time
* The amount of work that a computer can perform is reduced by separating “LOAD” and “STORE” instructions.
* RISC contains a Large Number of Registers to prevent various interactions with memory.
* In RISC, Pipelining is easy as the execution of all instructions will be done in a uniform interval of time i.e. one click.
* In RISC, more RAM is required to store assembly-level instructions.
* Reduced instructions need a less number of transistors in RISC.
* RISC uses the Harvard memory model means it is Harvard Architecture.
* A compiler is used to perform the conversion operation means converting a high-level language statement into the code of its form.

## CISC Architecture
* The term CISC stands for ‘’Complex Instruction Set Computer’’. It is a CPU design plan based on single commands, which are skilled in executing multi-step operations.
* CISC computers have small programs. It has a huge number of compound instructions, which take a long time to perform. Here, a single set of instructions is protected in several steps; each instruction set has an additional than 300 separate instructions. Maximum instructions are finished in two to ten machine cycles. In CISC, instruction pipelining is not easily implemented..

* The CISC machines have good acts, based on the overview of program compilers; as the range of innovative instructions are simply obtainable in one instruction set. They design compound instructions in a single, simple set of instructions.

They achieve low-level processes, which makes it easier to have huge addressing nodes and additional data types in the hardware of a machine. But, CISC is considered less efficient than RISC, because of its incompetence to eliminate codes which leads to wasting of cycles. Also, microprocessor chips are difficult to understand and program for, because of the complexity of the hardware.
## Characteristics
The characteristics of CISC architecture include the following.

* Instruction-decoding logic will be Complex.
* One instruction is required to support multiple addressing modes.
* Less chip space is enough for general purpose registers for the instructions that are 0operated directly on memory.
* Various CISC designs are set up with two special registers for the stack pointer, handling interrupts,  etc.
* MUL is referred to as a “complex instruction
## Comparison Between RISC and CISC
* RISC stands for ‘Reduced Instruction Set Computer Whereas, CISC stands for Complex Instruction Set Computer. The RISC processors have a smaller set of instructions with few addressing nodes. The CISC processors have a larger set of instructions with many addressing nodes.
